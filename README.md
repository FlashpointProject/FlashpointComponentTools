# Flashpoint Manager
This is a component manager for [BlueMaxima's Flashpoint](https://bluemaxima.org/flashpoint/). If all goes well, it will eventually become the primary method of downloading Flashpoint and maintaining its individual components.

A command-line version can be found [here](https://github.com/WumboSpasm/FlashpointManager-CLI).

## Testing
Because the component repository the application depends on does not yet exist, you must download the components.xml file from [here](https://gist.github.com/WumboSpasm/9faf5835d391288805bb7f6c17b8a0e0) and create your own component files in order to test it. However, I will discuss the creation of a comprehensive test repository with other Flashpoint staff and update this section if there are any developments.

## To-do
* Add more error checking
* Add more comments to code
