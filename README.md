# Flashpoint Component Tools
This repository contains GUI utilities for downloading, managing, or removing a copy of the [Flashpoint Archive](https://flashpointarchive.org/) using the component system.

A general-purpose command-line tool can be found [here](https://github.com/WumboSpasm/fpm).

## Tools
- `FlashpointInstaller` - "Installs" (downloads) Flashpoint with any selected components to a specified folder, and optionally creates desktop and Start menu shortcuts.
- `FlashpointManager` - Allows the user to add or remove components from an existing copy, or remove Flashpoint completely; intended for integration with the [Flashpoint Launcher](https://github.com/FlashpointProject/launcher).
