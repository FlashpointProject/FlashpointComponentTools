# Flashpoint Installer
This is a work-in-progress installer for Flashpoint. The core installation functionality (download and extract archive, create desktop shortcut)  has been implemented; however, my end goal is to allow us to explore more efficient ways of distributing Flashpoint.

## To-do
* Add automatic version detection
* Add updating functionality
* Allow some degree of customization of the Flashpoint install
* Discuss changes to Flashpoint that would provide better integration with the installer
